Author's description:

This is actually the hand from pokemon quest. I loved it, and I really wanted to see it on my laptop! So here it is. A retro, black and white hand cursor. I added 3 link select cursors because I had too many great ideas of what it could be! Also, it was a good idea to let people personalize the set a bit. Enjoy!
